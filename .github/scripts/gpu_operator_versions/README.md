# GPU Operator Versions Workflow

This workflow automates the process of checking for new versions of OpenShift and NVIDIA GPU Operator, updating version matrices, and triggering CI jobs.

## Overview

The version update automation:
- Fetches the latest OpenShift release versions from the official API
- Retrieves NVIDIA GPU Operator versions from container registries
- Validates GPU operator availability in OpenShift catalogs before triggering tests
- Updates the version matrix in `versions.json`
- Updates the signed/precompiled version matrix in `signed_versions.json`
- Generates test commands based on the support matrix in `settings.json` and `signed_settings.json`
- Creates pull requests with version updates

## Catalog Availability Checking

New GPU operator images may not immediately appear in all OpenShift operator catalogs. The workflow verifies catalog availability before tracking new versions.

### Behavior

- New GPU versions available in at least one active OCP catalog are tracked
- Versions not yet in any catalog are skipped and rechecked on the next run
- Tests are scheduled for all OCP versions with warnings where the operator is missing
- OCP version updates proceed independently of GPU catalog status

### Configuration

Environment variable `CHECK_CATALOG_AVAILABILITY`:
- `false` (default): Disable catalog checking - all new versions are tracked immediately
- `true`: Enable catalog checking - only versions available in OCP catalogs are tracked

**Note:** The automated CI workflow (`.github/workflows/update-versions.yaml`) sets this to `true` to ensure only catalog-available versions trigger tests.

### Manual Check

```bash
PYTHONPATH=.github/scripts python -m gpu_operator_versions.catalog_checker 25.10.1 4.20 4.19
```

## Configuration

The workflow requires a `settings.json` file that defines which OpenShift versions are in maintenance mode:

```json
{
  "openshift_support": {
    "4.12": {
      "status": "maintenance",
      "pinned_gpu_operator": ["25.3"]
    },
    "4.13": {
      "status": "maintenance",
      "pinned_gpu_operator": ["25.3"]
    }
  },
  "defaults": {
    "unlisted_versions": {
      "status": "active"
    }
  },
  "ignored_versions_regex": "^4.[0-9]$|^4.1[0-1]$"
}
```

**Key behavior:**
- **Active versions** (unlisted or `status: "active"`):
  - Test with new GPU operator releases
  - Test with GPU operator patch updates (if in latest 2)
  - Test with master bundle changes
- **Maintenance versions** (`status: "maintenance"`):
  - Only test when OpenShift gets a new patch (with their pinned GPU operators)
  - Do NOT test when GPU operators change (frozen configuration)
  - Do NOT test with master bundle changes
- New OpenShift versions automatically default to "active"

To move a version to maintenance mode, add it to `openshift_support` with status `"maintenance"` and specify which GPU operator versions to pin.

## Signed/Precompiled Driver Testing

The workflow also generates test commands for precompiled/signed driver tests. These run alongside regular tests in the same PR but are scoped to a subset of OCP and GPU operator versions.

### How it works

The same `update_versions.py` script runs twice: once for regular tests (using `versions.json` + `settings.json`) and once for signed tests (using `signed_versions.json` + `signed_settings.json`). The signed run uses two additional settings:

- `TEST_COMMAND_SUFFIX` env var: appended to job names (e.g., `-signed` produces `/test 4.22-stable-nvidia-gpu-operator-e2e-26-3-x-signed`)
- `signed_gpu_min_channel` in `signed_settings.json`: minimum GPU operator channel for signed tests (e.g., `"26.3"`). Channels below this threshold are excluded from both version tracking and test generation.

The `signed_settings.json` also uses a stricter `ignored_versions_regex` to limit OCP versions to 4.20+ (only versions with signed CI jobs in the release repo).

Signed/precompiled test commands are only commented on PRs Monday through Thursday. On Fridays and Sundays (the workflow does not run on Saturdays), only regular tests are triggered. Version tracking still runs on all scheduled days so no updates are missed.

## Data Sources

- **OpenShift versions**: Retrieved from OpenShift CI release streams API
- **GPU Operator versions**: Fetched from NVIDIA Container Registry and GitHub Container Registry
- **Version matrix**: Stored in `versions.json` (regular) and `signed_versions.json` (signed) and updated automatically
- **Support matrix**: Configured in `settings.json` (regular) and `signed_settings.json` (signed)

## Running the Workflow

### Prerequisites

Install dependencies:

```console
pip install -r .github/scripts/gpu_operator_versions/requirements.txt
```

### Manual Execution

Run the version update process:

```console
PYTHONPATH=.github/scripts python -m gpu_operator_versions.update_versions
```

### Environment Variables

The workflow supports several environment variables:
- `VERSION_FILE_PATH` - Path to versions.json file (Required)
- `TEST_TO_TRIGGER_FILE_PATH` - Path to generated test commands file (Required)
- `SETTINGS_FILE_PATH` - Path to settings.json (Optional, defaults to same directory)
- `TEST_COMMAND_SUFFIX` - Suffix appended to test command job names, e.g., `-signed` (Optional, defaults to empty)
- `CHECK_CATALOG_AVAILABILITY` - Enable catalog availability checking (Optional, defaults to `false`)
- `GH_AUTH_TOKEN` - GitHub authentication token (Optional)
- `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` - Request timeout in seconds (Optional, defaults to 30)

### Running Tests

First, make sure `pytest` is installed. Then, run:

```console
PYTHONPATH=.github/scripts python -m pytest .github/scripts/gpu_operator_versions/tests/ -v
```

## GitHub Actions Integration

- **Scheduled**: Runs nightly to check for new versions and creates pull requests when updates are detected
- **Manual**: Can be triggered manually via GitHub Actions workflow dispatch
